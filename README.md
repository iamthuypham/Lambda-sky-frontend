## Tech Stack
### React
React is a declarative language for creating interactive UIs. React updates and renders the right components when data changes. React allows encapsulated components to manage their own state. They can be composed to make complex UIs.

### React Router
React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with the application. React Router works wherever React is rendering.

### Redux
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps to write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. 

### Redux Form
The basic implementation of redux-form is simple. It is recommended to have basic knowledge of Redux state container, React and Higher-Order Components (HOCs).

### Material-UI
Material-UI components work in isolation. They are self-supporting, and will inject, and only inject, the styles they need to display. They don't rely on any global style-sheets such as normalize.css.

### Passport
Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

### Moment.js
Enable the ability to parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in JavaScript.


## Database
*Connecting to the database with MongoDB Compass*

- Clone the repo `$ git clone https://github.com/CarloC24/Lambda-sky.git`
- Install compass following these instructions https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/master/install/
- Copy `mongodb://carlo:carloc1@ds111622.mlab.com:11622/lambda-sky` from `index.js`
- Navigate to the `Connect to host` screen on MongoDB compass - it will recognize the copied link and fill in the fields for you
- You're all set! (edited)
